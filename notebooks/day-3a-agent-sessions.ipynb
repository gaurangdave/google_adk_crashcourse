This is a critical and highly impactful area in drug discovery. Let me elaborate:\n\n**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n\nBefore diving into AI's role, it's important to understand what a drug target is. A drug target is typically a specific molecule within the body (often a protein or a gene) that plays a crucial role in a disease process. By designing a drug that interacts with this target (e.g., inhibits it, activates it, or modifies its function), scientists aim to alleviate or cure the disease.\n\n**The Traditional Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\nTraditionally, identifying and validating drug targets has been a long, arduous, and often serendipitous process. It involved:\n\n*   **Extensive Biological Research:** Scientists would spend years studying disease mechanisms, identifying genes or proteins that seem important.\n*   **Hypothesis-Driven Experiments:** Based on existing knowledge, hypotheses would be formed and tested through countless experiments.\n*   **Limited Data Integration:** Integrating information from different types of experiments and data sources was challenging and often manual.\n*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Many disease-driving molecules were identified but lacked easily accessible binding sites for drugs, making them \"undruggable.\"\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding patterns in massive, complex datasets. This is precisely what's needed to overcome the challenges in target identification:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **Genomics:** AI can sift through millions of genetic variations (SNPs, mutations) across thousands of individuals to pinpoint genes that are consistently associated with a disease.\n    *   **Proteomics:** AI can analyze the abundance and modifications of proteins in different biological states to identify proteins whose levels or activity change significantly during disease progression.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** AI can study gene expression patterns (which genes are \"turned on\" or \"turned off\") in healthy vs. diseased tissues or cells to identify key regulatory genes.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** AI can analyze the small molecules (metabolites) involved in cellular processes to understand metabolic dysregulation in diseases.\n    *   **Integrating these:** The real power comes from AI's ability to integrate these different \"omics\" layers, providing a holistic view of disease at a molecular level. It can identify connections that wouldn't be apparent from studying each layer in isolation.\n\n2.  **Uncovering Novel Pathways and Interactions:**\n    *   AI algorithms can map out complex biological networks and identify previously unknown interactions between genes, proteins, and metabolites that contribute to disease.\n    *   This helps pinpoint crucial \"nodes\" within these networks that, if targeted, could have a significant therapeutic impact.\n\n3.  **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":**\n    *   Once a potential target is identified, AI can analyze its structural and functional characteristics to predict how likely it is to bind to a drug molecule.\n    *   This helps researchers prioritize targets that are more likely to yield successful drug development efforts.\n\n4.  **Identifying Targets for Previously \"Undruggable\" Diseases:**\n    *   By understanding complex biological mechanisms at a deeper level, AI can help identify novel ways to target proteins that were previously considered too difficult to drug. This could involve targeting protein-protein interactions, allosteric sites (sites other than the main active site), or even entirely new classes of molecules.\n\n5.  **Personalized Target Identification:**\n    *   AI can analyze an individual patient's unique genetic makeup and disease profile to identify specific targets that are relevant to their particular form of the disease, paving the way for truly personalized medicine.\n\n**Impact and Future:**\n\n*   **Faster Discovery:** AI significantly speeds up the process of identifying promising drug targets, reducing the time from initial research to potential drug candidate.\n*   **Increased Success Rates:** By identifying more relevant and druggable targets, AI can improve the overall success rate of drug development programs.\n*   **Tackling Challenging Diseases:** AI is opening up new avenues for treating diseases that have historically been difficult to address due to a lack of clear therapeutic targets.\n\nIn essence, AI acts like a super-powered detective, sifting through mountains of biological data to find the critical culprits (the targets) responsible for diseases and providing clues on how to best approach them with medication.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven target identification and validation is diverse and rapidly evolving.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
